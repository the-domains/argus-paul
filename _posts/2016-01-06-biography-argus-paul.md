**Biography**

My
name is Argus Paul Estabrook and I'm an emerging photographer and artist based
in Seoul, South Korea. As a Korean-American, I am deeply interested in Korean
identity and the forces that drive it.

I
was born in Ulsan, South Korea but my family relocated to the United States
just before I started public schooling. After receiving my Masters Degree in
Studio Art, I decided to return to the country of my birth to better understand
its culture.

While in the States, I studied
photography at Virginia Intermont College and received my MFA in Studio Arts
from James Madison University. Most recently, my body of work was the focus of
a featured article in Lomography Magazine. I am also currently exhibiting work
in both group and solo shows through out South Korea. Outside of photography, I
enjoy creating poetry and have been published in such literary magazines as,
Synecdoche Magazine, Driftwood Press, and The Ironic Fantastic.
