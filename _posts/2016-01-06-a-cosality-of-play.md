Under the daily hum of academic pressures, plastic surgery
advertisements, and fast food chains, a growing subculture of cosplay has taken
root on the outskirts of Gangnam, South Korea. Meeting usually one weekend
every a month at convention centers in Yangjae or Hangyeoul, Korean youth have
seemingly found a way to escape the pressures of societal perfection by
transforming into fictional characters they admire. 

They mostly meet and prepare in the metro stations closest
to the chosen venue, taking them over almost completely in a sea of cosmetic
boxes and costumes. Some spend hours applying make-up there, even going as far
as hiring make-up artists to help them become anime princesses. Others simply
wear used uniforms found in military surplus stores to act out war with their
friends. Cross-dressing is also extremely popular. For these few hours each
month, they are welcomed into a community where they can escape into fantasy.

But can escape be fully realized in a society that places
such a high value in personal appearance and consumerism? 

In this urban playground where fantasy lives are acted upon,
they must still contended with the reality of Korean hierarchical values.
Onlookers still see them amidst a landscape oversaturated in all manner of
advertisements. With so much product placement imposing itself onto every
aspect of their life, is their escape not a product itself?

The aim of my photography is not to judge those who find
community in this subculture, but to examine how they feel comfortable being
seen, as well as presenting an external environment that is impossible to
remove. Through the use of multiple exposures, I am able to share a story that
lives between fantasy and reality: A Cos'ality Of Play.
